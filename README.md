# Strong Support MT5 Indicator

This is the code for the Strong Support MT5 Indicator, a powerful tool designed to identify key support and resistance levels in the market, aiding traders in their decision-making process. The indicator has been developed to be used with the MetaTrader 5 trading platform.

## Description

The Strong Support MT5 Indicator is designed to calculate and display support and resistance levels on your trading chart. Support levels represent the price level where the market seldom falls below, while resistance levels indicate the price level the market seldom surpasses.

The code provided here will give you access to two main indicator buffers - SupportLevels and ResistanceLevels. These are arrays where calculated support and resistance levels are stored for each bar on the chart.

The indicator is initialized in the OnInit() function and the support and resistance levels are calculated in the CalculateSupportAndResistance() function. The OnDeinit() and OnTick() functions are placeholders for cleanup and real-time calculation logic respectively.
